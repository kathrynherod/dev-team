# JS Regiment

  * Read a bullet a day: https://github.com/krasimir/react-in-patterns
  * Use pull requests, and rebase before creating every PR ($git rebase -i HEAD~2)
  * Spend time (suggested two weeks) focusing on each group before moving onto the next.
    * Aggressively use the listed items in your code, even if it seems unnecessary.
    * Refactoring is part of the process.
